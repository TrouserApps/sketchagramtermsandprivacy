<p>TrouserApps, LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Sketchagram mobile application (the "Service"). Instead of using tons of legal jargon, we're just gonna say it how it is. 
No infrindgement, nor anything evil like that, was intended with this project -- especially with Instagram (owned by Facebook). We just thought this was a really fun app, and we've had 
lots of fun playing with it. Please use this at your own risk, knowing that the main intention is to draw (sketch) something in Sketchagram, then send your creation straight to the editing screen 
in the Instagram app so you can post it. We don't save any of your content/creations or information. Simple as that. Just fun stuff.</p>
