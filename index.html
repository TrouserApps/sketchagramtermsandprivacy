<p>Hello! Instead of using tons of legal jargon, we're just gonna say it how it is. No infrindgement, or anything evil/illegal/mischievous like that, is intended with this project. We just think this is a really fun app for all ages, and we've had 
lots of fun playing with it. Please use this app with the understanding that the main intention of it is to draw (sketch) something and then send your creation straight to the editing screen 
in the Instagram app so you can post it. We don't ever save any of your content/creations. This app doesn't gather personal information of any kind, either. 
If anything about this app needs to be changed because of some sort of legal situation -- please just contact us -- because we'll be happy to fix it immediately. We're pretty sure 
this paragraph contains some pretty nice sentence fragments. Anyway, this app is for you to have fun with. Simple as that. Just fun stuff and things and like such as.</p>
